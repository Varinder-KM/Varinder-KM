I am a senior-year student currently enrolled in the Computer Science Engineering program at Gulzar Group of Institutes, Punjab. I have contributed to open-source projects affiliated with Amahi and the GDSC JSS organization. Subsequently, I pursued coursework in Data Analytics and Data Science, delivered by esteemed companies such as IBM and Almabetter. Through these programs, I acquired proficiency in various areas, including machine learning, PostgreSQL, ETL processes, data visualization, and data analysis in the Python programming language. I worked as a Python developer for three months. In this role, I worked on projects involving Selenium, Python scripting, and the integration of third-party APIs. My professional skill set also extends to web development, as I have successfully completed various web development projects to further augment my capabilities in this domain.
