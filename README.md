I am a final-year B.Tech student at Gulzar Group of Institutes in Punjab. I have practical experience in working with AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud computing platforms and Big Data technologies such as Hadoop, Hive, Sqoop, and Spark. This experience has equipped me with the skills to develop scalable and efficient data solutions.

To enhance my skills, I pursued coursework in Data Analytics and Data Science from prestigious companies such as IBM and Almabetter. These programs have helped me gain proficiency in various areas, including Machine Learning, ETL processes, data management in PostgreSQL, data analysis and visualization in Python programming language.

I have also contributed to open-source projects affiliated with Amahi. I have worked as a Python developer for three months where I gained experience in Selenium, Python scripting, and integrating third-party APIs. My skill set also includes web development, and I have successfully completed various web development projects to further improve my capabilities in this domain.

I am passionate about bringing my diverse skill set, including practical experience with AWS and Big Data technologies, to the field of data engineering. I am actively seeking opportunities that allow me to leverage my expertise to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals.
